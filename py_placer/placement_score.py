"""Placement quality on a COPPER-FREE board -- the terms a lap can be ranked by (#894).

    python3 -X utf8 py_placer/placement_score.py BOARD [--json PATH] [--intent PATH]
                                                 [--length-groups JSON]

Why this exists
---------------
On a copper-free board every placement lap scores the same `blocking` (the
board's unrouted count, which is the ROUTING half's job) and the same `quality`
(`vias 0, copper_mm 0.0, segments 0`). So the ledger cannot rank two placements
and the plateau test has nothing to compare: measured on run 25, seven laps of
one board produced one number, while the layout that shipped had a crossed USB
pair, a connector whose pin order fought the bridge IC's, three nets pushed to
the back cutting the ground pour, and 22 vias for 24 nets. The routing half
paid for all of it and the placement half's instruments said clean.

NO SCALAR. There is deliberately no aggregate over these terms, and no weight
anywhere in this file. #694 is why: a corridor term's measured sign REVERSED
while an aggregate verdict kept printing PASS, because collapsing several
signals into one mark means no reader can say which of its inputs moved. Laps
are compared by `compare_terms`, which is PARETO -- better on every term it can
compare, worse on every term, or `mixed` with both sides named.

THREE of the six terms CALL an existing grader rather than mirroring it:
`pair_length` and `pin_order_crossings` read `board_context.pin_order_rows`,
and `cluster_to_pin` reads `floorplan.grade`'s measured proximity rows plus
`board_context.serves_map`. A re-implementation of a grader in this repo has
already been measured disagreeing with it 83 times, worst 0.234mm.

The other THREE deliberately do not, and each says why at its definition: the
nearest existing implementation measures a DIFFERENT QUANTITY.
`plane_cut_proxy` does not call `routability.corridor_cut_mm` (it needs a
declared corridor, and its chord is position-invariant along the lane, so it
cannot rank two placements that differ by a nudge); `balance` does not call
`check_pockets.census_scalars` (courtyard-area weighted, a hypot of both axes,
per-side); `edge_facing` does not call `escape.assign_faces` (one face per
pad, with a row's end pads sent to the row's ends -- it answers "which lane
does this pad escape through", not "which side of the part is it on"). All
three build on geometry primitives -- `legality.pad_rect`, `rect_area`,
`part_class.mechanical_parts`, `placement.body`, `escape._face_geometry` --
rather than on a second copy of a grader, and `edge_facing`'s core lives in
`placement.edge_facing` so `floorplan.rule_pins_to_edge` and the seeder read
the same number.

One REPORT-ONLY section rides beside the terms and is NOT one of them:
`length_groups` (#1252), each declared matched group's length-FLOOR spread --
the copper the placement forces each member to have, and how much the group
must add to match at all. It is not in `TERM_ORDER`, so `compare_terms` and
the lap ledger never read it; `length_group_floors` says why and what it
cannot see.

Vacuity
-------
A term that could not be measured reports `ran: False` with a `reason` and
`value: None`. It NEVER reports 0. "No differential pair on this board" and
"the pairs are all perfectly short" are different answers, and a score that
cannot tell them apart will rank a board nothing measured above one that was
examined and found wanting.

    Measured, and the reason this exists: `plane_cut_proxy` counts nets forced
