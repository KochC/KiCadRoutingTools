"""Rank place_seed seeds by ONE identical full-board probe each.

Run 7 hand-rolled exactly this: three seeds, each graded against the intent,
then compared -- and the comparison that actually discriminated was a
FULL-BOARD probe route per seed, not the portfolio's shared-window probe and
not crossings (crossings ranked seed 0 first; the probe measured seed 2 at
39 failures vs seed 0's 53 and run 7 shipped on seed 2). The skill's ladder
now calls for identical full-board probes on the seed axis; this CLI is that
step as one command instead of an afternoon of bookkeeping.

Per seed: place_seed subprocess (the seed must GRADE CLEAN against its own
intent -- a seed failing its gate is recorded but never ranked) -> one
full-board probe via converge.probe_route, every seed routed with the SAME
net patterns and the SAME route args and with NO timeout (#713: a verdict a
clock erased was dropped from the ranking, not ranked worse). A seed that
produces no verdict carries a `status` naming why. Seeds rank by probe
failures, then -- when failures tie -- probe vias, then probe copper_mm
(#1191: CLAUDE.md's tie-break; board_score's own copper measure, read off
the routed probe board), then router iterations.

A seed whose ONLY gate failure is decap rules (`decap_distance` /
`decap_pin_distance`, nothing unseated, no copper conflict seeded) goes
through the SEED-THEN-REPAIR arm (#1191): `place_seed --repair
--repair-decaps` writes seed_N_repaired.kicad_pcb, and when that passes the
same gate it is the board probed and ranked (gate `rep`). On a pile whose
intent arms the decap rule that is every seed, which used to leave nothing
rankable. Output: a ranked table, seeds.json in --out-dir, and a
JSON_SUMMARY line with best_seed and best_board.

    python compare_seeds.py board.kicad_pcb --intent floorplan.json \\
        --seeds 0 1 2 --out-dir seedcmp --ignore-nets GND VCC

Exit 0 when at least one seed was probed; 4 when every seed failed its
intent gate (nothing rankable); 2 for usage errors.
