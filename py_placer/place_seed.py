"""Generate an initial placement for an UNPLACED board from its floorplan intent.

Usage:
  python place_seed.py input.kicad_pcb output.kicad_pcb --intent floorplan.json

The placement stack refines and deliberately does not place from scratch
UNAIDED -- but a declared intent carries the constraints a from-scratch run
lacks: zones, edge bands, locks, decap rules. This tool turns that intent into
a legal starting placement (see placement/seeder.py for exactly what each
construct becomes), stamps the intent's must_lock refs `(locked yes)` into the
output, runs a quench polish over the free parts, and then GRADES its own
output against the same intent -- a seed that fails the intent it was built
from is a defect, not a result. An intent that declares `replicate[]`
(#1211) has each declared channel copy applied after the polish, through
`place_pose replicate`'s engine and verdict: written only when the copy
grades no worse than the seed (`summary.replicate[]` says which, and why).

Different --seed values produce genuinely different legal seeds (packing order
and target jitter); the same seed reproduces byte for byte. Compose with
place_portfolio.py to diversify and rank what this emits.

Exit codes: 0 seeded and graded clean; 2 bad arguments; 3 the board cannot be
seeded (no Edge.Cuts outline -- the outline is spec-owned and will not be
invented -- or the board is already placed / carries copper); 4 the seed was
written but parts could not be seated, a declared fixed pose was not
honoured (`fixed_refused`, #1054), or the intent grade has errors ON
PARTS THE SEED PLACED. A grade error on a part the seed was told not to move
-- `(locked yes)` in the file, or matched by the intent's `must_lock` -- is
printed and counted in `grade_errors_pinned`, and does not fail the gate:
it is a contradiction between the board and the intent, which only their
author can settle. Measured, run 27: a fixed USB socket declared
`along_edge: center` within 0.6 mm sits 1.75 mm off centre, and every one of
ten seeds failed on it, so nothing the seeder did could ever be ranked.
`--repair` keeps the same contract (#1193): a violator it may not move
because it is locked (`(locked yes)`, a `--lock` glob, a `fixed_poses[]`
ref) is named in `unrepairable_pinned_refs` and does not fail the gate; a
free violator it could not seat (`unrepairable_failed_refs`) does. The one
exception is pad copper past the board outline, where a lock is no waiver
(as in the seed gate, #1241): such a pinned ref is also named in
`unrepairable_pinned_off_board_refs` and fails the gate, since placement
stamps its own locks and check_assembly exempts none. The gate also charges
pad copper the DELIVERED board leaves past the outline (#1241,
`pad_copper_off_board_charged`): on any part `--repair` could move -- its
census charges every such part, a declared edge connector's band exempting
the body's overhang and never pad copper -- and, on a `--reseat` alone, on a
part the pass moved. A pinned part's copper there is named in
`pad_copper_off_board_pinned` and fails the gate by the same rule; an
unmoved part outside a `--reseat` scope is the board's own
(`pad_copper_off_board_unscoped`), reported and not charged. It also charges
the body pairs check_assembly gates on the delivered board (#1258,
`repair_pair_split`): a drawn body inside another's
(`containment_charged`) when a member moved, or on `--repair`, whose census
charges every such pair with a free member; and a courtyard pair past
check_assembly's blocking floors (`courtyard_blocking_charged`) when a
member moved against `--baseline`, else against the pass's input. A pair
of two pinned parts keeps the #1193 contract (`containment_pinned`,
`courtyard_blocking_pinned`: reported, not a gate failure), and the rest is
the board's own (`*_inherited`).

Exit 5 (#959): the PLAN is refused before anything is written --
`floorplan.plan_check` found an ERROR no arrangement can satisfy and the
seeder has no per-member answer for (`floorplan.PLAN_SEED_REFUSES`: a zone
smaller than its members' summed area, a part longer than its edge, a board
too small by area, a real reference used as a glob). Fix the zone plan; the
board is untouched. `JSON_SUMMARY.refused` is `plan_check` and the findings
ride with it. Every other plan finding is PRINTED (`PLAN [...]`) and the seed
proceeds: a zone a keep-out or a stranger's exclusive zone swallows is seeded
so the seeder can name the member it could not seat and why (#701, #797), and
a FILE-locked member already outside its zone keeps the pinned-part contract
above. `--repair` / `--reseat` REPORT everything and proceed, since a repair
works from a placement rather than a plan.

Every JSON_SUMMARY also carries `connector_requirements` (#974): which declared
edge-connector requirements were graded and on what basis, which were not
measured, and the connector errors on each side of the pinned split. It
reports; it never withholds the board and never changes an exit code.

The pad conflicts in the written board are reported in three buckets that
PARTITION `pad_conflicts_after` (#982): `pad_conflicts_seeded` is the seed's
own, a pair with a part it moved on at least one side; `pad_conflicts_unseated`
is a pair against a part it could NOT seat, which was written at the pose it
came in with, so whether anything lands on it is incidental to the seed;
`pad_conflicts_inherited` is the board's own. Only the first fails the gate,
and only when nothing is unseated -- an unseated part already fails it for a
better reason. All three are named on the console, because every one of them
is copper a fab will see. "Moved" is read off the WRITTEN board (#1241): a
part the polish or the post-polish re-seat moved counts too, charged on the
delta -- a pair the input board did not have, or one it made deeper -- as is
its rule-area band copper (`keepout_copper_seeded`).

It also carries `edge_floor_fallback` (#975): the declared edge connectors whose
seat leaves pad copper inside the board-edge floor because no pose the seat
ladder tried clears it, by ref, with the pads and why the seat could not move.
An edge seat prefers a pose that clears the floor and otherwise keeps the seat
it always chose, since an unseated connector is an unrouted one. Like
`connector_requirements`, it never changes an exit code. A seat is never kept
with pad copper PAST the outline, though (#1241): it is moved inward onto the
board, or it is not a seat. When the declared band can be met only with
copper past the outline, the band contradicts the footprint, and the
connector is seated on its edge with its pads on the board, clear of the
floor where any pose is: `edge_band_contradiction` names it, by ref, and the
grade's band error stands, so the seed exits 4 on the band. The
copper is also charged at the gate, wherever it comes from:
`pad_copper_off_board_seeded` names the parts whose pad copper the WRITTEN
seed leaves past the board outline, by the per-pad measure check_assembly
gates on -- wherever stage 1, the polish or the re-seat put them, or kept
them -- and a non-empty list fails the gate, since such a part can be neither
assembled nor routed. `pad_copper_off_board_locked` fails it too: a part
`(locked yes)` in the input that the seed could not move, since placement
stamps its own locks and check_assembly exempts none, so a lock would launder
the last lap's overrun. The board's own is an unlocked part outside a
partially-unplaced run's scope: named on the console and not charged at its
input pose, nor after the polish moves it, unless the move took its copper
further past the outline. `must_lock` alone exempts nothing: stage 1.5 seats
every unlocked, in-scope must_lock part. An unseated part is charged as
unseated. `oob_pad_copper_gating_count` is the written board's total,
inherited parts included.

The gate charges the BODY pairs check_assembly gates on, too (#1258), read
off its own grader (`grade_body_overlap`, through `body_gate_pairs`) on the
written board: `containment_seeded`, a part's drawn body inside another's
(`[a, b, area_mm2, contained_frac]`; no class waiver exempts it there), and
`courtyard_blocking_seeded`, a courtyard interpenetration past the run-23
floors (`[a, b, area_mm2, depth_mm]`; check_assembly gates it against a
baseline, and a seed's baseline is its input). Stage 1 keeps an edge seat
that crowds a placed courtyard when no rung clears it and leaves that
overlap to check_assembly; before this, glasgow_revC's pile seeded J3's body
71% inside SW1's and exited 0 on a NOT BUILDABLE board. A pair is the seed's
when a member is a part it placed -- moved, or unlocked and in the run's
scope at a pose it kept -- and is charged on the delta when its only moved
member is an out-of-scope part the polish nudged. `*_unseated` is a pair
against a part the seed could not seat, and `*_inherited` the board's own:
both members locked in the input, or outside a partial run's scope and
unmoved. Those two are named on the console and not charged. A locked
pair keeps #1193's pinned-part contract here, unlike off-board copper:
it is a contradiction between the board and the intent, which an
`overlap_waivers` entry settles as check_assembly does, and failing every
seed on it would leave compare_seeds nothing to rank (run 27).

And `reseat_declined` (#1117) on every summary of a seed (not of --repair /
--reseat, which run no post-polish re-seat):
the parts the post-polish re-seat could not put back into their zone, out of
a keep-out or out of another block's exclusive zone, by ref, with the rules
they broke and the rotation claim the search was held to. The re-seat
searches a declared part's `rotation` / `rotation_candidates` ladder ONLY,
never the fallback lattice, and the polish's swaps refuse to trade a declared
angle away, so a declared angle survives the polish. A part the re-seat
declines stays where the polish left it, named on a `NOT repaired` line, and
its grade error stands, so the seed exits 4. Before #1117 a declared part was
instead turned to fit and the seed exited 0. A declared EDGE claim is first
re-seated on its edge (#1240, `reseat_on_edge`: the repair's edge seat, aimed
at its zone's centre), kept when the part then grades no zone, keep-out,
exclusive-zone or edge error; the ordinary search, which wants the whole
courtyard on the board, would pull it off its edge. The line printed for a
re-seat names who broke the rule: the polish when it walked the part out of a
seeded pose that kept it, the seed otherwise.

def split_pad_pairs(worst, seeded, unseated, late=(), before=None):
    """Split the written board's pad pairs into the seed's and the unseated's.

    #1241: `late` names the parts the polish or the post-polish re-seat moved
    after stage 1 (`seeded` is read off stage 1's poses, which never saw
    them). A pair whose only moved members are late is charged on the DELTA
    against the input board, `before` ({frozenset pair: mm}): a pair the input
    did not have, or one moved deeper, is the seed's; one moved no deeper is
    the board's own -- the off-board and band channels' rule for a move after
    stage 1. With `before` None every late pair is charged.

    Returns `(mine, against_unseated)`, both in `worst` order. A pair is the
    seed's when either member is a ref it MOVED, and lands in the second list
    instead when the other member is a ref it could not seat. Pairs with
    neither member moved are in neither list: they are the board's own, counted
    from the total by the caller -- and a pair between TWO unseated parts is one
    of those, since the seed moved neither of them.

    #982. A part the seed cannot seat keeps the pose it came in with, and THAT
    pose is what gets written -- `placements` has no row for it and the writer
    leaves its block alone. (Since #1151 only when that pose makes no HARD
    conflict with what the seed seated, or the part is locked or already off
    the board; any other unseated part is STAGED below the board and written
    there, see `seeder._dispose_unseated`. A staged part has a placement row,
    so it is in `seeded` too and any pair on it is charged to the seed --
    staged parts sit 1 mm apart below everything, so none has been
    measured. The pairs below are, from #1151 on, the ones a clear or
    locked input pose still makes.) Later stages pass the pile as `exclude`
    (`seeder._try_place`: "the pile they still form at their meaningless input
    coordinates must not veto real poses"), so they pack onto that copper, and
    the pair then reaches the count through the partner the seed DID move. It
    is real copper -- on ulx3s SEED 1, `py_tools/check_assembly.py` grades
    `H4 <-> J1` a 1.5089 mm2 `pad_intersection`, BLOCKING, and the board NOT
    BUILDABLE -- so it stays named and counted. A pair in this bucket is not
    always that severe: ulx3s seed 0's H4-J2 is a 0.191 mm graze on a board
    `check_assembly` still grades buildable. What it is not is the seed's answer
    for the parts it placed: whether a hole lands on an unseated part is
    incidental to the seed, and the count swung 0 -> 1 at seed 0 and 5 -> 8 over
    seeds 0..9 when AUDIO1 was seated 0.386 mm further inward for a board-edge
    copper fix (#975's A/B; a sham nudge of the same size on the unmodified
    engine reproduces it, so the cause is the displacement, not the fix). Its
    own bucket keeps `pad_conflicts_seeded` a number the seed can be held to.

    How widespread this is, measured over seven boards at seed 0 (19 charged
    pairs, 17 of them against a part that could not be seated) plus ulx3s at ten
    seeds (5 of 5): ulx3s 5 of 5, rp2350 15 of 16, orangecrab 2 of 3, and
    nothing at all on the four boards that seat everything. On rp2350 those
    fifteen are ONE unseated part, U6, whose 75 pads sit at the designer's pose.
    Every number here is re-measured by `tests/measure_982_unseated_pairs.py`,
    which prepares its boards the way the issue does; read that file's
    docstring for the recipe, because these numbers do NOT reproduce from a
    board prepared some other way.

    The exit code cannot move by this split: `gate_reason` returns the intent
    arm whenever anything is unseated, and when nothing is unseated the second
    list is empty by construction. A ref that is somehow BOTH moved and
    unseated is charged to the seed, the direction that keeps the gate honest;
    the seeder keeps the two disjoint, so this is a tie-break nothing reaches.

    The alternative reading -- treat the written pose as an obstacle for later
    stages -- was prototyped and MEASURED WORSE. It unseats parts that were
    seated: ulx3s 20 -> 25 unseated over ten seeds (H4 at seeds 1 and 4, H1, H2
    and H3 at seed 7), rp2350 1 -> 3, and hole conflicts up on two boards. It
    does not even buy stability, because at ulx3s seed 7 it swapped three pairs
    against J1/J2 for three against the H1/H2/H3 it had just unseated -- the
    seat predicate is courtyard-level, so an unseated part's whole courtyard
    (14.5 x 52 mm for ulx3s J1/J2) becomes a keep-out. It also ran about 20%
    slower. Trading seats for a cleaner count is the wrong way round when an
    unseated part's nets cannot be routed at all, so the search is left alone
    here; this judgement is the branch's, not a rule quoted from CLAUDE.md.
