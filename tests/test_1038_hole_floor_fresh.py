"""The copper-to-hole floor is read FRESH: from the project as it is now, and
on the GUI from the live board (#1038, #1238).

`obstacle_map.resolve_hole_clearance` prices NPTH holes at the board's declared
`min_hole_clearance` (raised to its `fab_floor_origin`), and since #1038 any
value above 0 also turns on the via-copper keep-out around them. Two ways it
served a value that was no longer the board's:

1. Its cache was keyed on the board PATH for the life of the process. A CLI
   step is a fresh process, so it always read the current file; the GUI
   plugin is ONE process for a whole KiCad session, so a user who saved a new
   Board Setup min hole clearance kept routing at the first value read.

2. The GUI never saw the live board's rule at all. It read the file beside
   the board -- stale until saved, and absent on an unsaved board (#1238).

Now the file read is keyed on the project's stamp (mtime, size, inode), and a
PCBData built from pcbnew answers the rule from its in-memory design settings
through `live_rules_provider`, at call time -- the rules the live board
DECLARES (`fix_kicad_drc_settings.live_declared_rules`). A live value AT
pcbnew's factory default counts only when the project declares the key or a
GUI writer of this session targeted it, so the GUI and the CLI price the same
floor on a board pcbnew just loaded, and after each one's writeback.

wx-free: fake boards through the real declared view and provider, with
pcbnew's factory values injected. The real-pcbnew half is
tests/gui_parity/test_live_hole_clearance.py.
