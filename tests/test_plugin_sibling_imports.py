"""A plugin module imports its plugin-only siblings RELATIVELY (#726 follow-up).

KiCad loads the plugin through the repo-root `__init__.py`, which puts the
repo root on sys.path; `action_plugin.py` (and each tab module) then adds
py_router/, py_placer/ and py_tools/. Nothing adds kicad_routing_plugin/
itself. So a module that exists ONLY there -- `gui_utils`, `placement_run`,
... -- cannot be imported by bare name in KiCad: `from gui_utils import
live_footprints_by_key` raised ModuleNotFoundError there, which took the
Placement tab's Apply down before it moved a part (and, inside a broad
`except`, turned the fanout tab's cap moves into "Cap optimization skipped").

The GUI gates could not see it: every one of them puts kicad_routing_plugin/
on sys.path, so the bare name resolved in the test and nowhere else.

Two halves, both measured every run:
  1. the PREMISE -- on the loader's sys.path a plugin-only module does not
     resolve by bare name (if that ever changes, this file says so instead of
     enforcing a rule nobody needs);
  2. the RULE -- no `import X` / `from X import` (level 0) of a plugin-only
     module anywhere in kicad_routing_plugin/, inside a try or not: a broad
     `except` around one is how the fanout case shipped silently.

ON ipc-migration the loader is `kicad_routing_plugin/ipc_entry.py`, the
plugin.json entrypoint, which KiCad runs as a TOP-LEVEL SCRIPT: it has no
parent package (a relative import there fails) and it puts kicad_routing_plugin/
on sys.path itself, so ITS bare imports are the correct spelling and it is
exempt by name. The rule still holds for every other module, which loads as
`kicad_routing_plugin.<name>`: there a bare sibling import resolves only
through the entry script's sys.path insert, and then as a SECOND module object
beside the package one, splitting module state (gui_utils' status mirror,
its UI-yield throttle).
