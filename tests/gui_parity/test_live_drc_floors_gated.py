"""#693: no DRC-floor writer may run without the 'fix DRC settings' gate.

The bug: the GUI has independent DRC writers, and only some were gated, so
unchecking "Fix DRC settings after routing" suppressed one and left another
rewriting Board Setup anyway. The reporter watched Minimum annular width go
0.15 -> 0.05 with the box unchecked (#693). It was ungated at ALL FIVE call
sites -- every routing tab plus the plan executor -- so this is a drift guard,
not a spot fix: the CLI gates its twin (fix_project_for_output) on
--no-fix-drc-settings, and a new call site must not silently reintroduce it.

THIS BRANCH (ipc-migration) has a different writer set from the SWIG branch,
so the gate checks the writers that exist here rather than the ones that do
not:

  * `update_live_drc_floors` -- the SWIG live design-settings writer -- does
    NOT exist: kipy cannot write live design settings. Checked anyway, so a
    port of it cannot arrive ungated.
  * `gui_utils.apply_drc_settings_fix` is the ONE writer every routing tab
    (signal, differential, planes, fanout) goes through, and it carries the
    gate INTERNALLY. That makes the helper itself the choke point, so the
    check is that the gate is still inside it -- a call site needs no gate of
    its own, and losing the internal one would silently ungate all four tabs
    at once.
  * a DIRECT `fix_project_for_output` call in the plugin bypasses that choke
    point, so each one must carry its own gate. ai_plan.py has the only such
    call: it owns the real dialog, reads the checkbox into a local, and is
    the IPC plan path's only floor writer (the SWIG branch gates its live
    writer instead, which would leave the checkbox inert here).

The box is also a VETO a plan cannot override (main's 0a9b652b): the executor
holds a user's untick through every step, and puts the user's value back in a
`finally`, so no way a plan ends (completion, Stop, a raising step) leaves the
box where the steps put it -- that is what settings_persistence saves on
close. That half is front-agnostic and checked here too.

Pure AST, no wx and no kipy -- runs anywhere in about a second.
