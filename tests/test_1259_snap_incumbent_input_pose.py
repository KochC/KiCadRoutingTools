"""#1259 (2): the snap ranker's off-board escape branch measures the
INCUMBENT at the part's INPUT pose, not at the refused request.

#1256 (72b9821d) made `pose_ops._ranker_state` judge the moved part from its
pose on the input board, then `apply_move` it to the request so the sweep
centres there. `QuenchState.candidate_valid`'s off-board escape branch read
its incumbent at the part's CURRENT pose, which is that request -- so an
off-board request licensed every pose merely LESS off the board than it,
and the re-grade, which compares with the input (where the part was on the
board), refused each one. The #1257 pad-copper conjunct in the same branch
read the request as its incumbent too.

The fix: `QuenchState.incumbent_at[ref]`, the pose both incumbent measures
read (`_incumbent_violation`, and `_pad_copper_past` in the escape branch).
`_ranker_state` sets it to the input pose before the move; every other
caller leaves it empty, so the incumbent stays the part's current pose.

Measured on esp_prog, `set R3 146.0 101.5 --snap` (R3 at 141.0 101.5 on the
input; the request puts a pad 1.008 mm past the east edge):

  --radius 2: before 21 ranked (+175 lattice), all 12 re-graded refused,
      exit 4; after 0 ranked (+196 lattice), all 6 refused, exit 4.
  --radius 4: before 3 ranked, all 9 refused, exit 4; after 9 ranked, the
      7th try, (143.25, 104.25) at 3.89 mm, passes the re-grade, exit 0.

What each case pins:

* the ranker's state pins R3's incumbent at its input pose, and its
  `_incumbent_violation` is the input pose's, not the request's; a plain
  `make_state` leaves `incumbent_at` empty;
* the escape branch's pad-copper conjunct reads `incumbent_at` (test_1257's
  `_scoped` R2, whose pad reaches 4 mm past its courtyard): the same
  candidate is refused from an incumbent whose pads are on the board and
  admitted from one whose pads are further out, whatever the current pose;
* every pose the snap ranker returns passes the caller's own re-grade, at
  radius 2 and 4 (before: 21 and 3 ranked, every one refused);
* the CLI: radius 2 refuses with 0 ranked, exit 4; radius 4 snaps to a
  ranked pose the re-grade passes, exit 0 (before: exit 4).

#1277, the converse: R3's INPUT pose off the board (staged at 146.0 101.5,
the issue's recipe). The escape branch is then open, and the poses merely
less off the board than the input filled the ranking's cheapest 24: `set R3
143.4 102.0 --rot 180 --snap --radius 4` wrote (142.9, 104.75), `legal:
false`, past a legal pose 0.49 mm nearer the request. The fix ranks the
poses the ordinary gate admits (`QuenchState.escape_closed`) FIRST, as the
`ranked_on_board` rung, and a nearer lattice pose may not trade that rung's
answer for a worse one. The cases:

* `escape_board_term` is the input's board term from the off-board input
  and None from the on-board one; closing the branch refuses a pose merely
  less off the board and still admits one on it;
* every `ranked_on_board` pose has no board term, and the first is the
  legal pose the issue names;
* the CLI writes (142.9, 104.25), legal (before: (142.9, 104.75), not);
* `set R3 145.0 97.5 --snap --radius 3` keeps the on-board answer, legal
  (before: the lattice traded it for (145.25, 97.5), a pad past the outline);
* the no-snap refusal suggests (142.9, 104.25) (before: (142.9, 105.75));
* controls, the same as before the fix: the issue's two requests the other
  proposed fix would have changed ((143.4, 101.0) radius 3 writes the
  ranked (145.9, 101.75); (147.5, 101.5) radius 4 refuses), and the
  on-board input above (no `ranked_on_board` rung; the 7th try).

Found reviewing #1277: `pose_score.rank_poses` labelled every pose it
ranked `legal: True`, the escape branch's too. With R3 off the board,
`converge poses --ref R3 --radius 3` called (146.0, 104.5) at 270 degrees
legal with both pads past the east edge; at step 0.5 the sweep ranks 6
poses the ordinary gate admits and 108 it does not. Now `legal` is the
ordinary gate's verdict and those carry `escape: True`:

* off the board, each pose's label agrees with `candidate_valid` with the
  branch closed, `diagnostics['escape_admitted']` counts them, and at home
  every pose is legal with no `escape` key (the control);
* `converge poses` reports the pose as an escape pose, in the JSON and on
  stderr, and place_pose's no-snap suggestion at (145.4, 103.75) says it is
  only less off the board; controls: the `--radius 4` suggestion (142.9,
  104.25) is legal and worded as before, and the snap from (143.4, 101.0)
  still writes (145.9, 101.75), its pose now marked `escape`.
