"""#1241: place_seed's gate charges pad copper it placed past the outline.

#975's floor fallback keeps an edge connector's seat "rather than leave the
connector unseated", and on a body-less part stage 1 tests only pad CENTRES
against the board, so a band `min` that pads on the board cannot reach left
J1's copper 1.2 mm past the north edge. Nothing after stage 1 charged it:
place_seed exited 0 on a seed check_assembly calls NOT BUILDABLE. The gate now
reads the measure check_assembly gates on (`oob_pad_copper_gating_refs`)
at the WRITTEN poses, for every part except the board's own -- an UNLOCKED
part outside a partially-unplaced run's scope, at its input pose or moved by
the polish no further past the outline -- and the floor note says the copper
is off the board rather than "inside the board-edge floor". A lock exempts
nothing: placement stamps its own, so a lap-1 lock would launder its
off-board seat into lap 2's exit 0.

Since the seat half of #1241 no edge seat keeps pad copper past the outline
(test_1241_edge_seat_on_board.py), so the issue's own J1 no longer reaches
this gate: it is seated on its edge with its pads on the board and the band's
minimum named. The gate's attribution is pinned here on R2 instead, a part
whose pad lies 4 mm outside its courtyard.

Since #1257 the seat search and the polish refuse that copper too
(test_1257_seat_pad_copper.py), so neither puts R2's pad past the outline
any more. The tests that need such a seat -- lap 0 and what is built on it (a
seat the seed KEPT, must_lock, a lock the last lap stamped, in place) and the
polish moves -- run place_seed with both checks' courtyard-only form put back
(`blind=True`, place_seed as #1241 left it), so the gate is still handed the
copper they are about: what they pin is the gate's attribution, which
answers for every step that can put copper there, not the search or polish.
