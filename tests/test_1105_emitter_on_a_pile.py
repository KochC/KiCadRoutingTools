"""#1105, the emitter half: `check_floorplan --emit-intent --decaps-from` must
not promise a pin stage that cannot run on the board it emits from.

place_seed's per-supply-pin stage (2.5) serves the supply pins of owner ICs
seated BEFORE it -- placed, file-locked, or declared as a fixed pose, a
must_lock pattern or a zoned block. On a pile none is, so the stage claims
nothing; run 38's StickHub emitter still promised "will seat 38 cap(s)".
Since #1105's pile default, stage 3.5 runs on a pile without being asked and
claims those caps once the centroid stage has seated their owners, so the
line on a pile says THAT, and how to turn it off. Where 3.5 is off (an input
that is not a pile, or the explicit off switch) the line says the stage will
claim NO cap, names the owners the centroid stage seats after it, and names
the three ways to declare them. It reads the same owner set as the stage
(#1249: `seeder.decap_owner_refs`, so esp_prog's 3-pad regulator U2 is one
of them).

Cases:
* a `make_unplaced` pile of esp_prog and of tigard, each with its own board
  as the `--decaps-from` reference: the forecast's early set is empty, 3.5
  is armed by the pile default, and the line says the caps are claimed at
  stage 3.5 and how to turn that off; the seed on esp_prog's pile claims 0
  at stage 2.5 and some at 3.5, and none at all with 3.5 off;
* the same forecast with 3.5 off: the line says NO cap, names the
  declaration routes and where 3.5 is on by default;
* control: the same esp_prog intent with U1 and U2 declared as fixed poses
  at the reference's poses -- the forecast moves their caps to stage 2.5,
  the line switches to "can claim up to N", and the seed claims caps;
* with no forecast the line states the scope as a scope, never "will seat".
