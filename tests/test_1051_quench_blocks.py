"""#1051 / #1052 / #1043 phase 4: the QUENCH holds declared rows and rigid
blocks together, and holds decap / proximity tethers.

What each case pins, and why:

* a row the seeder formed stays formed through `place_seed`'s polish
  (splitflap, the detector's four rows): the GRADER's `array_formation` on
  the written board, read off JSON_SUMMARY. The control quenches the same
  --no-polish seed with the gate's `rigid_blocks` emptied, and breaks a row --
  which is what the polish did before this phase.
* a member leaves its row ONLY through a disclosed release: a locked part
  dropped onto one member, at a displacement cap no block offset can clear,
  releases exactly that member (`rigid_released`, clause `legality`), and
  every other member keeps its offset from its siblings.
* `rigid: true` blocks move as one: the block translates (`moved_as_block`
  > 0) and its SHAPE -- the multiset of member poses relative to its corner
  -- is unchanged (a same-footprint swap inside a rigid block is allowed and
  keeps it); the control without `rigid` pulls the same parts apart.
* a ref in two groups is deduped and disclosed (`groups_deduped`), kept by
  its rigid group.
* an IC move that would strand its caps is REFUSED on the tether (the refusal
  tallied under `decap_distance`), while the IC+caps cluster can take the
  same offset.
* the tether terms equal the GRADER's reading on every tethered pair of a
  real board (glasgow_revC under the run-32 intent, plus three proximity
  claims in both arities and both bases), at the board's own poses and at
  perturbed ones.
* every caller receives it: place_optimize (JSON_SUMMARY `rigid`, `tethers`)
  and place_portfolio are RUN on a rows+decaps intent; place_route_loop's
  quench call is read in the source (it quenches only after a route), and
  must pass the gate `resolve_intent_gate_for_cli` built.
* bit-identity: with no array, no `rigid` block and no tether declared, the
  quench's placements and metrics equal those recorded at 8bcce3fba
  (`fixtures/1051/quench_unarmed_baseline.json`, from
  `fixtures/1051/record_quench_unarmed.py`; the esp_prog case re-recorded
  for #1266, whose pad gate sees U2's drawn tab).
